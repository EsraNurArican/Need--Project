# Need--Project
Need ++ was designed to be a social aid themed web application and we continue to develop our project.

The web application called Need ++, which we plan to design within the scope of our software engineering course, 
is an online platform that we plan to bring together the needy and benefactors without anyone in between.
With this web application, individual or collective assistance requests can be made and people who want to meet them can deliver their help to those in need.

Basically, the main features planned to be included in our application are as follows:
- Declaration of need
- Need fulfillment

With the requirement announcement feature, you can share anything you need on this platform on any subject.
For example, baby clothes, stationery, etc.

You can also support those in need with the need-solving feature, 
in matters that you think you can help from among the postings shared on the site.

In order to use these features, both sides of the system must first be registered.
Of course, we do not share the information of our users with anyone in order to ensure the security of the information regarding the confidentiality of the help calls.

To mention some of the features that we think to add as we develop our project;
We plan to enrich our application with features such as categorizing shared need notices, 
adding search feature by keywords, adding urgency classification and perhaps adding a map view in the future.

With this application idea, which we consider to be an important project in the name of social responsibility and volunteering, 
our main goal is to provide assistance to many people.
